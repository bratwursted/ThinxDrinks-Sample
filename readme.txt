ThinxDrinks Sample Code

This is some sample code from the ThinxDrinks iPhone app that was available in the iTunes App Store during March 2013. It was designed to help attendees at that year’s South by Southwest conference in Austin TX find interesting day shows and navigate around town. 

This code is from the first tab of the app which used the user’s location to find events. The events are fetched from Core Data and plotted on a map (NearbyMapViewController) or viewed in a list (NearbyListViewController). The  TDFlipTabViewController is a container view controller that allowed the user to flip back and forth between those views.
